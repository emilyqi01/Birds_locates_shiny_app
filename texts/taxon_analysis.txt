You can interactively explore the distribution of bird species over multiple years by playing with the "Select Years" gadget. The histogram on the left will change accordingly. The data from 2009 to 2023 reveal diverse trends among the five most observed bird species. Although each species exhibits fluctuations, Catharus ustulatus (depicted in sea blue) consistently marks its presence throughout the years, albeit with minor variances. Notably, Setophaga occidentalis (in gold) often dominates the observations, capturing the largest share, except in anomalous years like 2015 and 2016 when a mysterious dip occurred across all species. Investigating these anomalies would require delving into both humanistic and environmental factors to unearth the underlying causes.

Poecile rufescens (in blue) shows a troubling decline in recent years, suggesting potential challenges in its habitat or other impacting conditions. Troglodytes pacificus(in turquoise)  fluctuates with a pronounced surge around 2015 - 2017, hinting at transient factors influencing its population. Meanwhile, Sitta canadensis (in red) displays a generally stable pattern, punctuated by sporadic peaks that pique curiosity about the factors driving these occasional increases. Further research into the year 2020 is necessary because during this period, all observations declined by at least 50%.

Predicting future trends based solely on past distribution data may not be entirely sufficient, yet it does offer valuable insights. For 2024, we can anticipate Catharus ustulatus to maintain its frequency with a possible slight increase, contributing approximately 25-30% of the total observations, while Poecile rufescens might decline by 5-10%, representing about 20-25% of the total. Setophaga occidentalis and Sitta canadensis are expected to stabilize, each accounting for 15-20% of the observations, and Troglodytes pacificus should hold steady, comprising about 10-15% of the total. For more precise forecasting, employing a time series model could be advantageous to analyze seasonal variations, particularly as these birds may exhibit migratory behaviors.
